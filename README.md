# Sorting Algorithms Playground

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Playground! Here, you can explore different sorting algorithms and have some laughs along the way.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Bubble Sort

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)

### 2. Merge Sort

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n log n)

### 3. Quick Sort

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)

### 4. Radix Sort (LSD)

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(nk)
  - Worst Case: O(nk)

### 5. Insertion Sort

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)

### 6. Selection Sort

- Time Complexity:
  - Best Case: O(n^2)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)

## Execution Time with Examples

Let's take an example list [5, 3, 9, 1, 4, 8, 6] and measure the execution time for each algorithm:

- Bubble Sort: O(n^2) - Can be slow for large datasets.
- Merge Sort: O(n log n) - Efficient for large datasets.
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) - Efficient for large datasets, but worst-case scenario exists.
- Radix Sort (LSD): O(nk) - Efficient for integers with a fixed number of digits.
- Insertion Sort: O(n^2) - Simple, but less efficient for large datasets.
- Selection Sort: O(n^2) - Simple, but less efficient for large datasets.

Feel free to explore and have fun with these sorting algorithms! ðŸš€
